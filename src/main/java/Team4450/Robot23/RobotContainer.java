    // Persistent Commands.

	// Some notes about Commands.
	// When a Command is created with the New operator, its constructor is called. When the
	// command is added to the Scheduler to be run, its initialize method is called. Then on
	// each scheduler run, as long as the command is still scheduled, its execute method is
	// called followed by isFinished. If isFinished it false, the command remains in the
	// scheduler list and on next run, execute is called followed by isFinihsed. If isFinished
	// returns true, the end method is called and the command is removed from the scheduler list.
	// Now if you create another instance with new, you get the constructor again. But if you 
	// are re-scheduling an existing command instance (like the ones above), you do not get the
	// constructor called, but you do get initialize called again and then on to execute & etc.
	// So this means you have to be careful about command initialization activities as a persistent
	// command in effect has two lifetimes (or scopes): Class global and each new time the command
	// is scheduled. Note the FIRST doc on the scheduler process is not accurate as of 2020.
	
	// GamePads. 2 Game Pads use RobotLib XboxController wrapper class for some extra features.
	// Note that button responsiveness may be slowed as the schedulers command list gets longer 
	// or commands get longer as buttons are processed once per scheduler run.

		// So any function that operates valves will trigger the watchdogs. Again, the watchdog 
		// notifications are only a warning (though too much delay on main thread can effect robot
		// operation) they can fill the Riolog to the point it is not useful.
